# -Traffic-Accident-Analysis-Using-EDA-

Understanding traffic accidents is crucial for improving road safety and reducing casualties. In my latest project, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 209,306 traffic accident records to uncover key patterns and trends.

🔍 Key Insights from the Analysis:
✅ Most Accidents Occur in Clear Weather – Contrary to popular belief, most accidents happen on clear days rather than in bad weather.
✅ Peak Accident Hours – A high number of accidents occur during rush hours, particularly in the afternoon and early evening.
✅ Severe Injuries vs. Road Conditions – Poor road surface conditions correlate with a higher number of severe injuries.
✅ Primary Causes of Accidents – Factors like distracted driving, speeding, and violation of traffic signals are leading contributors.

📈 Tech Stack & Methodology:
✔️ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
✔️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
✔️ Statistical Analysis & Data Visualization

Through visualizations like heatmaps, bar charts, and pie charts, I identified the most critical factors contributing to accidents. This analysis can be valuable for traffic authorities, urban planners, and policy makers to develop data-driven strategies for safer roads.

Would love to hear your thoughts! What measures do you think can help reduce traffic accidents? 🚗💡
